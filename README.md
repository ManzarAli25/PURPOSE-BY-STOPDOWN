# Purpose by Stop-Down

**Purpose by Stop-Down** is a mobile-first CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application designed to empower businesses with smarter client management, real-time analytics, and streamlined communication.  
The project aims to provide an intuitive and scalable platform for businesses to manage leads, customers, sales, and workflows without the complexity of traditional CRMs.

---

## 🌟 Vision & Philosophy

This project is built with the belief that technology should **empower people, not just serve them**. Instead of focusing on rituals, superficial tools, or complexity, **Purpose by Stop-Down** emphasizes:
- Practicality and sustainability
- Empowering users to become self-reliant
- Making data-driven business growth accessible to everyone

Just as in life, the app focuses on **purposeful action** rather than redundant tasks.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is split into **Frontend** and **Backend** for maintainability and scalability.

### **Frontend (React Native with Expo)**
- User Interface (UI) optimized for mobile-first experience
- Built with React Native and Expo for cross-platform support
- Smooth navigation and responsive design
- Planned features for offline-first usage

### **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**
- REST APIs for frontend communication
- Authentication & Authorization
- Business logic (CRM workflows, data processing)
- Database interaction (SQL or NoSQL depending on scaling needs)
- ML-powered anomaly detection (planned for sales & behavior patterns)

---

## 📦 Backend Package Roles

The backend is modular, with each package responsible for a specific concern:

- **user_preprocessor.py** → Cleans, encodes, and prepares user data  
- **user_predictor.py** → Machine learning models for user behavior prediction  
- **network_preprocessor.py** → Cleans and prepares network/connection logs  
- **network_predictor.py** → Detects anomalies or risks in user/network interactions  
- **zero_day_detection_pipeline.py** → Integrates all anomaly detection (user + network) for stronger security

This modular design ensures that **semantic anomalies** (user behavior) and **temporal anomalies** (log timelines) can be combined into an **ensemble detection system** for identifying unusual patterns.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Provide a **scalable CRM solution** accessible to startups and SMEs.
- Focus on **empowering businesses** with actionable insights rather than overwhelming them with data.
- Encourage a **self-reliant ecosystem**, where users can manage clients and growth without depending on costly third-party CRMs.
- Extend towards **AI-driven insights** for predicting customer needs and improving retention.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo), JavaScript/TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (planned), SQLite (for dev)

## Structure

- `backend/` - FastAPI application with structured folders for future expansion
  - `app/api/` - API routes (ready for expansion)
  - `app/core/` - Core configurations
  - `app/models/` - Database models (ready for MongoDB)
  - `app/services/` - Business logic services
- `frontend/` - React Native with Expo

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx expo start
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /purpose` - Returns the purpose message

### End-to-End Testing

1. Start the backend: `cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npx expo start`
3. The React Native app will fetch and display the purpose message from the backend

## Future Enhancements

The project is structured to easily add:
- MongoDB integration in the backend
- Authentication system
- Additional API endpoints
- More React Native screens
